In this paper I will discuss Carl Hempel and Paul Oppenheim's Inductive Statistical model (I-S model), which tells us what a good scientific explanation is.

Before discussing the I-S model, I would like to give an explanation that we can apply the model to later.
Recent psychological research has revealed that disrupting brain activity during sleep reduces your ability to form memories of experiences earlier in the day.
Let us call this (i) the sleep-memory association.
(ii) Carl is a pre-med student at UCLA.
(iii) Carl's classes require him to recall many facts about human anatomy.
(iv) Unfortunately, Carl is an insomniac and regularly has interrupted sleep.
Keeping these premises in mind, let us now turn to the I-S model.

A scientific explanation requires premises that do the explaining and a conclusion, which needs to be explained.
We call the former explanantia and the latter the explanandum.
The explanantia and explanadum also need to be in the correct order.
Consider an explanation for why Carl did poorly during his last quarter, in which we swap premise (i) for our conclusion.
Running through our example sentence yields a poor explanation of the sleep-memory association.
But these premises do not work if they are false because scientific explanations also require their premises to be true.
If Carl sleeps well but blame his bad grades on his lack of sleep, we would have a poor explanation.

The I-S model has a third requirement: at least one of the premises must be a statistical law of nature, without which the argument would not be valid.
The sleep-memory association premise is our explanation's statistical law of nature.

A scientific explanation must have empirically verifiable premises.
Suppose we said instead that an angel whispers to Carl wrong answers whenever he takes tests.
Given no way to verify supernatural phenomena, this explanation would not be a scientific explanation.
Thus, it seems reasonable that the I-S model requires empirically verifiable premises.

Finally, there is the requirement of maximum specificity, which says that an explanation must include relevant premises.
Consider the explanation about Carl's performance at school, adding a fifth premise: (v) Carl has always done well in school, despite his insomnia.
Given this last premise, our conclusion that "Carl did poorly during his last quarter at UCLA," seems unlikely and unjustified.
Thus, it seems reasonable to require a scientific explanation to include all relevant premises.

But, there is a problem with the requirement of maximum specificity; the requirement is vague.
It is difficult to say precisely what is relevant in an explanation and what is not.
Given our example explanation, what other information should we include about Carl?
We could include information about the time he goes to bed, the amount of noise in his room, the amount of REM sleep that he gets, or the quality of his mattress.
In short, there could be any number of premises that might influence the strength of the inductive argument.

Finally, let us consider a requirement that statistical explanations be strong inductive arguments.
It seems reasonable to require statistical explanations to be inductively strong arguments.
If the sleep-memory association applied only ten percent of the time, it seems that our explanation would not be good.

But consider a potentially good explanation that is inductively weak.
Epidemiologists worry that for every 100,000 people that visit the Olympic games in Brazil, 50 people contract the Zika virus; a seemingly low number.
Suppose that we give an explanation about someone contracts the virus:
(i) people who visit Brazil have a small chance of contracting the Zika virus,
(ii) Paul visited Brazil,
(therefore) Paul contracted the Zika virus.
This explanation meets all the requirements of the I-S model but a lay person might say that explanation is poor, while an epidemiologist might say it is good.
Thus, the requirement seems to work for some explanations and fail for others.

We have applied the I-S model to an example explanation and seen that it has reasonable requirements for scientific explanations but still suffers some difficulties:
(i) it is difficult to say what is relevant in a scientific explanation, and
(ii) we do not know whether we should always require explanations to be inductively strong arguments.
