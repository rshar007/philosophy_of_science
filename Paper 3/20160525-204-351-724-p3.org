* Introduction
# Brian said that the introduction can simply be one or two sentences
In 1962 the physicist and philosopher Thomas Kuhn published /The
Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which proposed a complex
description of the scientific method. In this paper I will discuss
Kuhn's views about the process of normal science and the paradigmatic
theories that are essential for it.

* Normal science
** Participation in normal science
- scientists spend most of their time doing normal science example
  + introduce an example of normal science, linguistic theory
  + universal grammar
  + humans are born with the innate ability to acquire language
  + we will not argue for or against the theory
  + we will use universal grammar as a case study for Kuhn's views
- explain what Kuhn means by normal science
  + explain Kuhn's views on normal science
    - a scientific commited to working together
      + science journals, book publishing
      + conferences
      + lab experiments
** Three activities that scientists engage in
# three activities that scientists engage in during the process of normal science
- Normal research (gathering data)
  + Wug test, shows that children who have acquired a new word can apply
    complex grammatical manipulations
- Matching data with theory
  + Taking the results from the Wug test to explain how that fits or does
    not fit with what the theory predicts
- Theory formulation
  + Refining the theory based on the accumulation of data
  + Have the theory make more predictions
  
** Difference between main hypotheses and auxilliary hypotheses
# discuss the difference between main hypotheses of a theory and auxilliary hypotheses
- scientists doing normal science assume a main hypothesis
  + universal grammar main hypothesis:
    - the ability to learn a language is hard-wired into human brains
- auxilliary hypotheses of a theory.
  + regions of the brain associated with universal gramamr
  + universal grammar is only available during a critical period

* Paradigms

** Normal science is a puzzle solving activity
# If normal science is a puzzle-solving activity, what two features are 
# essential for it
- Kuhn says that normal science is a puzzle solving activity
- snake cube puzzle 
  + description of the puzzle
    - chain of cubelets are connected by an elastic band that runs through them
  + goal
    - aim of the puzzle is to put the blocks back together so that 
  + rules
    - rotate the cubes freely
    - arrange the cubelets so that they form a single large cube
    - obviously, cannot cut the elastic band
# Kuhn argues that paradigms are essential for normal science by presenting 
# normal science  as a kind of puzzle solving

# how does the paradigm provide these two features?
  
* Ancient science vs modern science
  
- what goes on during pre-paradigm state
- not well organized
- not very effective
- debate about fundamentals

- striking piece of work appears
- insight into the workings of some part of the world
- model for investigation
- no debate about fundamentals
# Ancient scientific works tend to be long, self-contained works that are accessible to
# the general educated public

# Contemporary scientific work tends to be in the form of short articles that are impenetrable
# to non-specialists

# How does Kuhn explain this fact in terms of paradigms?
