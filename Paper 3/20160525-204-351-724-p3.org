# A: Normal science
# ########################
# most scientists spend their time participating in normal science

# three activities that scientists engage in during the process of normal science

# discuss the difference between main hypotheses of a theory and auxilliary hypotheses

# ########################
# B: Paradigms
# ########################
# Kuhn argues that paradigms are essential for normal science by presenting normal science
# as a kind of puzzle solving

# If normal science is a puzzle-solving activity, what two features are essential for it

# how does the paradigm provide these two features?

# ########################
# C: 
# ########################

# Ancient scientific works tend to be long, self-contained works that are accessible to
# the general educated public

# Contemporary scientific work tends to be in the form of short articles that are impenetrable
# to non-specialists

# How does Kuhn explain this fact in terms of paradigms?
