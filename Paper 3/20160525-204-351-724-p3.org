* Introduction
# Brian said that the introduction can simply be one or two sentences
In this paper I will discuss Thomas Kuhn's views about the process of normal
science and the paradigmatic theories that are essential for it.

* Normal science
** Participation in normal science
- scientists spend most of their time doing normal science example
  + introduce an example of normal science, linguistic theory
  + universal grammar
  + humans are born with the innate ability to acquire language
  + we will not argue for or against the theory
  + we will use universal grammar as a case study for Kuhn's views
- explain what Kuhn means by normal science
  + explain Kuhn's views on normal science
    - a scientific commited to working together
      + science journals, book publishing
      + conferences
      + lab experiments
** Three activities that scientists engage in
# three activities that scientists engage in during the process of normal science
- Normal research (gathering data)
  + Wug test, shows that children who have acquired a new word can apply
    complex grammatical manipulations
- Matching data with theory
  + Taking the results from the Wug test to explain how that fits or does
    not fit with what the theory predicts
- Theory formulation
  + Refining the theory based on the accumulation of data
  + Have the theory make more predictions
  
** Difference between main hypotheses and auxilliary hypotheses
# discuss the difference between main hypotheses of a theory and auxilliary hypotheses
- main hypothesis is...
- auxilliary hypotheses are...
  + cumulative

* Paradigms
# If normal science is a puzzle-solving activity, what two features are essential for it

# Kuhn argues that paradigms are essential for normal science by presenting normal science
# as a kind of puzzle solving

# how does the paradigm provide these two features?

* Ancient science vs modern science

# Ancient scientific works tend to be long, self-contained works that are accessible to
# the general educated public

# Contemporary scientific work tends to be in the form of short articles that are impenetrable
# to non-specialists

# How does Kuhn explain this fact in terms of paradigms?
